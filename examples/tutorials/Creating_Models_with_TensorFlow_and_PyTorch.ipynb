It depends on whether you want to use TensorFlow/PyTorch APIs or DeepChem APIs for training and evaluating your model.  For the former case, DeepChem's `Dataset` class has methods for easily adapting it to use with other frameworks.  `make_tf_dataset()` returns a `tensorflow.data.Dataset` object that iterates over the data.  `make_pytorch_dataset()` returns a `torch.utils.data.IterableDataset` that iterates over the data.
